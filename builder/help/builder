Builds structures using schematic files with a turtle or a command computer. Schematics can be downloaded from sites such as http://www.planetminecraft.com.

Requirements
============
 * Advanced Mining Turtle
 * Chest (any type)
 * Wrench (any mod)

Alternatively

 * Command Computer
 * Chest (any type)

Installation
============
> pastebin run uzghlbnc
> package install core
> package install builder
> reboot

Setup
=====
Place the turtle or command computer on top of a chest at the corner of the build location.

Copy a schematic file to the turtle/command computer (see downloading instructions if on a server)

Building
========
Run:
> builder <schematic file>

The first time you run the program, you must select a wrench. Place a wrench into the chest. Go to the supplies list and double-click the SelectAWrench item. Select the wrench and apply.

If interrupted during building, you can resume by placing the turtle back in the original location and restarting the program.

Wrenches
========
EnderIO, Thermal Expansion, and Applied Energistics wrenches will work (only wrenches that can spin pistons will work).

To determine if a wrench can be used, right click the side of a piston with the wrench. If the piston rotates, then the wrench can be used. Some wrenches work better than others.

Downloading schematics
======================
Single Player
-------------
Simply copy a schematic file into the computer's folder.

Multiplayer
-----------
Option 1: Use wget if the schematic is available for download (unreliable).

Option 2: Transferring via pastebin (reliable)
To create a base64 file from a command line, do:

* linux / max:

base64 -w0 NAME.schematic > NAME.schematic.base64

* windows (I haven't tried this - but google said this will work):

certutil -encode NAME.schematic tmp.b64 && findstr /v /c:- tmp.b64 > NAME.schematic.base64
Upload the base64 file to pastebin.

To download and convert the base64 file back into a schematic file, do:

> base64dl.lua <filename> <url> 

You can download a simple test schematic using:

> base64dl.lua chicken.schematic https://pastebin.com/raw/vxpHBUky

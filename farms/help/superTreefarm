An advanced tree farming program for use when you have gathered enough resources to fulfill the requirements (see the treefarm program for a day 1 tree farming program).

The turtle will refuel itself from charcoal that it will make from the logs gathered (no fuel is required initially).

Requirements
============
* Advanced Turtle
* Diamond Pickaxe
* Standard Modem
* Block Scanner
* Entity Sensor
* Furnace
* Vanilla Chest
* Sapling
* GPS

Setup
=====
> pastebin run uzghlbnc
> package install farms
> reboot

The turtle will need some fuel initially.

The tree farm fits exactly in one chunk. It's best to have a mostly level ground around the center of the farming area as the turtle will only collect saplings that have fallen to the same level as the turtle.

To align the turtle perfectly in one chunk, position the turtle 8 blocks diagonally from the bottom left corner.

Place all the required items into the inventory.

To start the program, run:

> superTreefarm
A startup file is created automatically the first time the program is run (usr/autorun/superTreefarm.lua).

If the turtle does not get any saplings from the initial tree, another sapling in the turtle.

Tips
====
At any time, you can add additional saplings into the turtle's inventory. The modem is only needed for GPS. Wireless network can be disabled via System->Networking.

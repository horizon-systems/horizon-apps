An efficient crop farmer. The turtle will harvest and replant the same crop in it's place.

The turtle will NOT refuel itself. You can use the lavaRefuel program (core package) to fuel the turtle as needed.

Requirements
============
 * Turtle (advanced recommended)
 * Diamond Pickaxe
 * Block Scanner
 * Vanilla Chest

Setup
=====
> pastebin run uzghlbnc
> package install farms
> reboot

Prepare the area to be farmed by planting crops on a level area (with a few exceptions - see crop list below). The farm can be any size.

Place a vanilla chest (or several) around the farm for the turtle to drop items into.

Place the turtle 1 level above the crops. The turtle will harvest crops immediately below.

Place into the turtle the block scanner and diamond pickaxe. Add in some of the items used for replanting.

To start the program, run:

> farmer

A startup file is created automatically the first time the program is run (usr/autorun/farmer.lua).

Crop List
=========
 * Wheat
 * Carrots
 * Potatoes
 * Beetroots
 * Nether wart
 * Reeds
 * Melon
 * Pumpkin
 * Cactus: Plant 1 level below the other crops
 * Cocoa beans: The cocoa beans must be at the same level as the turtle. Recommended to plant at the edge of the farm.

Configuration
=============
After the program is run initially, a configuration file is created (usr/config/farmer). This file can be edited to add custom plants or upgrade the vanilla chest to a larger chest (from a mod). If any changes are made, the program will need to be restarted.
